## Benchmarking with other sampler

In order to keep this repository small, the benchmark dumps had been separated into a different submodule repository. To clone the benchmark dumps that had been previously ran (and processed), simply initialise the submodule and clone it with:

```sh
# initialise and show progress (since it's relatively slow) of clone
git submodule update --init --progress
```
